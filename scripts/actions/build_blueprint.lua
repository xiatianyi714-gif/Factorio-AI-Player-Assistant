-- build_blueprint: build a WHOLE reachable blueprint (starter books, player

-- read the entities or copy positions. Resolution and normalization live in
-- scripts/blueprint.lua; the per-step walking/placing machinery is
-- build_plan's (same task shape, so its tick runs unchanged). Failed steps
-- (missing items, blocked ground) are reported per step like build_plan.
